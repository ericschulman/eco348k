Welcome to ECO 348k! As part of the class, you will be completing coding excersizes involving webscraping and data analysis. I plan to upload helpful code to this github repository (written in Python) that I review in sections. Although it is not required that you use git or Python for this class, they are helpful skills to have for industry and research.

Below I've provided links to help you install Python and Anacondas (a set of useful Python packages) as well as other helpful software for the course. This guide assumes that you are somewhat familiar with installing software. I will update it with more detail as needed. There are many good tutorials for installing these packages out there.


# Setting up Python and Anacondas 
Python is an open-source, object-oriented programming language, particularly well-suited for scientific computing because of its extensive ecosystem of scientific libraries and environments. Anacondas is free Python distribution, including over 195 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, and data analysis.  These packages will help you complete the excersizes.

## Windows

### Setting up Python

* First Download Python. Most likely you want the `Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.0) (sig)`
https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

* According to the tutorials: Now go to START | All Programs | ActiveState ActivePython (version number) 

* You can click the Python command line option to see if Python is installed.

Below is a further resource that explains how to install Python on Windows. There are many good tutorials out there.

### Setting up Anacondas

Below you can find set up instructions for Anacondas for Windows. Make sure to download Anacondas for Python 2.7. 

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html

I think it is as simple as following the installer's instructions. If it asks, make sure to add Anacondas to my PATH enviroment variable. If you forget this step, you will need to add it manually which is complicated.


## Mac

### Setting up Python

You already have it! Open up the Terminal (search for it using finder).

* Type `python` to see if Python is running.

* Type `exit()` to leave the Python shell.


### Setting up Anacondas

Below is a guide for setting up Anacondas. In order to install you will need to download the Anaconda installer for macOS from the link below. After you download the installer you will can run the `.pkg` file. If it asks, make sure to add Anacondas to my PATH enviroment variable. If you forget this step, you will need to add it manually which is complicated.

# Other Helpful Software

This section describes how to install other helpful software for the course. This software is peripheral to doing the assignments, but it will improve your quality of life. They are also very standard.

## Text Editors

Below are links to install popular text editors. These are not required, but they make it easier to type and format code by highlighting syntax. You can find installation instructions on their websites

## Git
Git is a version control system for software. Think of it like a 'dropbox' for code although it does more than that. Below are links/instructions for setting it up.
